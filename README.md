Vagrant Host Manager
====================
`vagrant-hostmanager` is a Vagrant 1.1+ plugin that manages the `/etc/hosts`
file on guest machines. Its goal is to enable resolution of multi-machine
environments deployed with a cloud provider where IP addresses are not known
in advance.

Status
------
The current implementation is a proof-of-concept supporting the larger
objective of using Vagrant as a cloud management interface for development
and production environments.

The plugin has been tested with Vagrant 1.1.5.

Installation
------------
Install the plugin following the typical Vagrant 1.1 procedure:

    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager

Usage
-----
The plugin hooks into the `vagrant up` and `vagrant destroy` commands
automatically. When a machine is created or destroyed, all active
machines with the same provider will have their `/etc/hosts` file updated
accordingly. Auto update may be disabled by setting the
`config.hostmanager.auto_update` attribute to false in the Vagrantfile.

To update the `/etc/hosts` file on each active machine manually, run the
following command:

    $ vagrant hostmanager

A machine's IP address is defined by either the static IP for a private
network configuration or by the SSH host configuration. To disable
using the private network IP address, set `config.hostmanger.ignore_private_ip`
to true.

A machine's host name is defined by `config.vm.hostname`. If this is not
set, it falls back to the symbol defining the machine in the Vagrantfile.

In addition, the hostmanager.aliases configuration option can be used to provide aliases for your host names.

Example configuration:

  Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.hostmanager.auto_update = true
    config.hostmanager.ignore_private_ip = false
    config.vm.define "example-box" do |node|
       node.vm.hostname = "example-box-hostname"
       node.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.42.42"
       node.hostmanager.aliases = %w(example-box.localdomain example-box-alias)
    end
  end
